📝 AI Mood Journal
🌟 Project Description

The AI Mood Journal is an intelligent mental wellness assistant that helps users track their emotions, reflect on their daily moods, and receive personalized coping strategies. Users can either type or speak about how they feel, and the system uses AI-powered sentiment analysis & natural language processing (NLP) to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, stress, or anxiety.

Based on the detected mood, the journal suggests:

✅ Coping strategies (e.g., meditation, journaling prompts, mindfulness tips)

🎵 Mood-based playlists for relaxation or motivation

🧘 Breathing exercises & affirmations for emotional balance

This project combines Generative AI + Sentiment Analysis to provide a simple but powerful tool for mental health self-care.
